# GitHub Copilot Instructions

These instructions define how GitHub Copilot should assist with this project. The goal is to ensure consistent, high-quality code generation aligned with our conventions, stack, and best practices.

## üß† Context
ok
- **Project Type**: System Library / Cross-Platform App / Distributed Systems / CLI Tool
- **Language**: C++
- **Framework / Libraries**: STL / CMake / GoogleTest
- **Architecture**: Modular / Layered / RAII / OOP / Component-Based

## üîß General Guidelines

- Use modern C++ (C++17 or C++20 where supported).
- Prefer RAII for resource management.
- Favor smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) over raw pointers.
- Use `const`, `constexpr`, and `noexcept` to express intent.
- Keep headers clean‚Äîavoid logic in header files.
- Use `clang-format` for consistent formatting.
- Favor readability, modularity, reusability, performant, and exception safety.
- Use **CamelCase** for naming classes, structs, functions, and variables as an industry standard.

## üìÅ File Structure

Use this structure as a guide when creating or updating files:

```text
src/
include/
tests/
  unit/
  integration/
build/
```

## üß∂ Patterns

### ‚úÖ Patterns to Follow

- Use RAII for all resource ownership (memory, file handles, etc.).
- Encapsulate with classes and clean header/implementation separation.
- Favor the Rule of 5 or Rule of 0 when managing custom types.
- Use interfaces (`abstract class`) for testability and polymorphism.
- Prefer `enum class` over unscoped enums.
- Use assertions (`assert()`) and logging macros for debug checks.
- Use CMake targets and `target_include_directories` for modular build config.
- Use `std::optional` or `std::variant` for nullable/union-like types.
- For multithreading, prefer lock-free mechanism for best performance

### üö´ Patterns to Avoid

- Don‚Äôt use raw pointers for ownership unless performance-critical and documented.
- Avoid macros for constants‚Äîprefer `constexpr` or `inline` `const`.
- Don‚Äôt put implementation logic in header files unless using templates.
- Avoid global variables unless necessary and wrapped in a namespace or singleton, or better in a context/profile if there is a chance of having simultaneously different values for different inputs.
- Don‚Äôt overuse inheritance; prefer composition or other pattern which allow dependency injection
- Avoid manual memory management unless absolutely required.

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

- Use `GoogleTest` or `Catch2` for unit testing.
- Isolate dependencies using mock interfaces or adapters.
- Test core logic in isolation from I/O or rendering subsystems.
- Use `CMake` to register and run tests via `ctest`.
- Consider to use build wrapper for sonar, sanitize for memory leak, etc...
- Test constructors, copy/move semantics, and edge cases.

## üß© Example Prompts

- `Copilot, create a C++ class for a thread-safe queue using std::mutex and std::condition_variable.`
- `Copilot, implement an abstract class Drawable with a draw() method and two subclasses.`
- `Copilot, write a CMakeLists.txt file that builds all .cpp files in src and links Boost.`
- `Copilot, write a GoogleTest unit test for the MathUtils::Factorial function.`
- `Copilot, implement a RAII wrapper for a FILE* handle using std::unique_ptr and a custom deleter.`

## üîÅ Iteration & Review

- Always review Copilot-generated code for memory safety and correctness.
- Use comments to explain complex logic and guide Copilot suggestions.
- Refactor output to match the project's code conventions.
- Run `clang-tidy`, `cppcheck`, or sanitizers on generated code for static analysis.
