# GitHub Copilot Instructions

These instructions define how GitHub Copilot should assist with this project. The goal is to ensure consistent, high-quality code generation aligned with our conventions, stack, and best practices.

## 🧠 Context

- **Project Type**: System Library / CLI Tool / Embedded App
- **Language**: C
- **Framework / Libraries**: POSIX / GNU libc / Make / CMake
- **Architecture**: Modular / Layered / Embedded RTOS / Driver-Oriented

## 🔧 General Guidelines

- Use idiomatic, portable C.
- Write small, reusable functions—avoid deeply nested logic.
- Use descriptive names; avoid single-letter variables except in loops.
- Always define header files (`.h`) for public interfaces.
- Use `const` and `static` appropriately for scope and immutability.
- Stick to consistent formatting (e.g., `clang-format` or GNU style).
- Prioritize memory safety and avoid undefined behavior.

## 📁 File Structure

Use this structure as a guide when creating or updating files:

```text
src/
  core/
  drivers/
  include/
  platform/
  utils/
tests/
  unit/
  integration/
build/
```

## 🧶 Patterns

### ✅ Patterns to Follow
- Use modular design with `.c` and `.h` pairs.
- Encapsulate functionality behind clean interfaces.
- Prefer stack memory where possible; use `malloc` only when needed.
- For embedded or low-level apps, abstract hardware using driver layers.
- Use preprocessor macros responsibly (`#define`) and prefer `const` or `enum` for constants.
- Centralize configuration in `config.h`.

### 🚫 Patterns to Avoid
- Don’t use `goto` unless absolutely necessary (e.g., error cleanup).
- Avoid global variables unless required (e.g., ISR flags).
- Don’t write logic directly in `main()`.
- Avoid tight coupling between modules.
- Don't ignore return values of system/library calls.

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

- Use `Unity`, `CMock`, or `Check` for unit testing.
- Structure code for testability by minimizing side effects.
- Separate platform-specific code for easier mocking.
- Validate memory usage and leak safety via Valgrind or `asan`.

## 🧩 Example Prompts

- `Copilot, write a C function that reverses a string in-place.`
- `Copilot, create a header and implementation file for a circular buffer library.`
- `Copilot, write a Makefile to compile all .c files in the src directory.`
- `Copilot, implement a timer interrupt handler for an STM32 microcontroller.`
- `Copilot, write unit tests for the parse_config() function using Unity.`

## 🔁 Iteration & Review

- Copilot output should be reviewed and validated via static analysis or compiler warnings.
- Ensure code complies with memory safety and boundary checks.
- Use comments to clarify intent and guide Copilot for better suggestions.
